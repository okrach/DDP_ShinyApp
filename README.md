# DDP_ShinyApp
RStudio Shiny App for the Developing Data Products  at Coursera

This is a very simplistic application intended to calculate number of days between the specified (input) date and the next Christmas.

The only input from the user is the date.

The only output is the the number of days between the input date and December 24, 2016.
